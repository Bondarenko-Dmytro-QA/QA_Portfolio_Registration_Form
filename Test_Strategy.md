# Test Strategy: User Registration Form

### 1. Introduction
This document outlines the high-level strategy for testing the new user registration functionality on the `book-ye.com.ua` website. The primary goal is to ensure that the registration feature is functional, reliable, and provides a positive user experience, thereby allowing new users to create accounts successfully.

### 2. Scope
#### In Scope:
*   Functional testing of all input fields (First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, Password, etc.).
*   Validation rule testing for all required fields (mandatory checks, format validation).
*   UI/UX testing to ensure the form's layout and style conform to the design mockups.
*   Execution of both positive (successful registration) and negative (error handling) scenarios.
*   Basic cross-browser compatibility checks on major desktop browsers.

#### Out of Scope:
*   **Performance and Load Testing:** Testing the form's behavior under heavy user load is not included.
*   **In-depth Security Testing:** Advanced security checks like SQL injection, detailed XSS, or brute-force attack prevention are excluded.
*   **API-level Integration Testing:** Testing the integration with third-party services (e.g., email providers) at the API level is not part of this strategy.
*   **Usability Testing:** Formal usability testing with real focus groups is not planned.

### 3. QA Approach
A multi-layered approach will be used to ensure comprehensive coverage:

*   **Functional Testing:** To verify that all functional requirements are met and the feature works as expected.
*   **UI/UX Testing:** To ensure the form's layout, styles, and user experience align with the design specifications.
*   **Compatibility Testing:** To ensure consistent behavior and appearance across different web browsers.
*   **Negative Testing:** To check the system's resilience to invalid data, unexpected user actions, and to ensure proper error handling.

### 4. Test Environment
Testing will be conducted on the following platforms to ensure broad coverage for the target audience:

*   **Operating Systems:** Windows 10, macOS (latest version).
*   **Desktop Browsers:** Google Chrome (latest), Mozilla Firefox (latest), Safari (latest).
*   **Mobile Emulation:** Basic responsiveness checks will be performed using Chrome DevTools to simulate common mobile viewports (e.g., iPhone, Android).

### 5. Entry & Exit Criteria
These criteria define when the testing process can start and when it is considered complete.

#### Entry Criteria (When to start testing):
*   The user registration feature is deployed to the designated test environment.
*   All necessary requirements, user stories, and final design mockups are available and approved.
*   The test environment is stable and accessible.

#### Exit Criteria (When to stop testing):
*   All planned test cases have been executed at least once.
*   There are no open Blocker or Critical severity defects related to the main functionality.
*   The pass rate for test cases meets the agreed-upon threshold (e.g., 95%).```
