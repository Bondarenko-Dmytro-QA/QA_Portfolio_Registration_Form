# Test Plan: User Registration Form

### 1. Introduction
This document provides a detailed, tactical plan for executing the testing activities for the new user registration feature, as outlined in the corresponding **Test Strategy**. The objective is to define the specific tasks, resources, schedule, and risks associated with this testing effort.

### 2. Test Artifacts (Deliverables)
The following documents will be created and maintained throughout the testing lifecycle:

*   **Checklist:** For high-level, exploratory testing and quick verification.
*   **Test Cases:** For detailed, step-by-step validation of functional requirements.
*   **Bug Reports:** For clear and concise documentation of all identified defects in Jira.
*   **Test Summary Report:** A final report summarizing the testing results and providing a quality assessment.

### 3. Resources and Tools
*   **Personnel:** 1 Junior QA Engineer.
*   **Tools:**
    *   **Bug Tracking:** Jira (or a similar tool) for logging and tracking defects.
    *   **Browser Analysis:** Chrome DevTools for inspecting elements, analyzing network requests, and checking console errors.
    *   **API Testing (for future stages):** Postman for any related API-level validation.

### 4. Schedule (Estimate)
This is an estimated timeline for all testing activities related to this feature.

| Phase                  | Estimated Effort (hours) |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Requirements Analysis & Test Design | 8                        |
| Test Execution (Cycle 1) | 8                        |
| Regression Testing     | 4                        |
| **Total Estimated Time**   | **20 hours**             |

### 5. Risks and Mitigation
This section identifies potential risks that could impact the testing process and outlines a mitigation plan for each.

*   **Risk 1:** The test environment is unstable or unavailable due to frequent deployments.
    *   **Mitigation:** Maintain constant communication with the development team to stay informed about deployment schedules. Allocate buffer time for potential re-testing.

*   **Risk 2:** Requirements are ambiguous or change during the testing cycle.
    *   **Mitigation:** Proactively schedule clarification meetings with the Product Owner or Business Analyst before testing begins. Ensure all changes are documented and communicated to the team.

*   **Risk 3:** Defects found late in the cycle require significant re-testing.
    *   **Mitigation:** Prioritize testing based on risk. Execute critical path test cases (e.g., successful registration) as early as possible
